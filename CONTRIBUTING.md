### Contribute Code
We welcome any contribution of code to this repository, from bugfixes to new
features. In order to simplify code review and speed up the process of adding
new features, please follow the steps below for every single fix / enhancement.
Adding multiple features and fixes to one pull request will lead to more
complicated code review and you risk your changes being declined because of
things that have nothing to do with them.

Follow these steps to contribute code:

1. Open an issue describing what you want to change (follow one of the previous
    chapters).
2. Create a fork and implement your changes
3. Open a pull request to `master`
